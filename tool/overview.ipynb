    "The tool is designed alongside the formal language for modelling multilayer networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the tool is to provide an easy way of visualising and analysing the modelled network, as well as simulating using a variety of options based on established methods such as Gillespie and Kappa. Implementation of additional features (e.g. model reduction techniques, etc.) is also planned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the tool will have a number of domain-specific case studies included out-of-the-box, serving as a demonstration of the capabilities of the modelling language and the tool itself."

    "In this overview, we will examine a simple 3-node, 2-layer network which aims to describe the spreading process of an epidemic. One layer represents the physical interactions between nodes, the other - virtual interactions (e.g. dissimenation of information on a social network). Infection is possible in the physical layer, whereas infection awareness travels in the virtual layer. A node that was made *aware* in the virtual layer is less likely to become *infected* in the physical layer."
